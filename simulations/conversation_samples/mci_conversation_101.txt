Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! It looks like you're in a meeting room with some refreshing drink options. Which one do you feel like having right now: the Coke, the apple juice, or the 7 Up?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh dear... uh... the apple one, was it?

MCI Assistant: Yes, that's the Martinelli's apple juice. It's right in the center. Would you like me to help you with it?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, please. I seem to be having a little trouble today.

MCI Assistant: Of course, I'm here to help. Let's open it together and enjoy that refreshing apple juice.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. That's really nice of you.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! Enjoy your drink. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, I will. This is just what I needed.

MCI Assistant: I'm glad to hear that! Just relax and enjoy. If you want to chat or need anything else, I'm here for you.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thanks, dear. I appreciate it. I think I'm just going to sit back and enjoy this drink.

MCI Assistant: That sounds like a great idea. Just take it easy and enjoy your evening. I'm here if you need anything else.
Elderly Person with MCI: Alright, dear. Thank you again for your help.
