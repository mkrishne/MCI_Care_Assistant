Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! How are you doing tonight? Have you been enjoying a drink while sitting here? It looks like there's some Coca-Cola, apple juice, and 7UP on the table. Do you have a favorite?
Elderly Person with MCI: Hmm...I'm not too sure. Which one is the apple juice again?

MCI Assistant: The apple juice is in the glass bottle, right in the middle of the table. Do you feel like trying it?
Elderly Person with MCI: Apple juice...yes, I like the apple juice. Could you pass it to me dear?
