Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! How about we sit at the table and enjoy a drink together? Would you like some apple juice, a Coke, or maybe a 7UP?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, umm.. Juice, I think. No, not juice. The other one... not 7UP, not juice...

MCI Assistant: Sure, would you like a Coke then?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, yes. That's the one. A Coke, please.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! Here you go. Would you like to chat while you enjoy your Coke?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, let's chat. How are you doing?

MCI Assistant: I'm doing well, thank you! How about you? How has your day been so far?
Elderly Person with MCI: It's been a good day. I think... I can't remember everything. But yes, a good day.

MCI Assistant: I'm glad to hear it's been a good day. Sometimes it's nice to just enjoy the moment. Is there anything special you enjoyed today?
Elderly Person with MCI: Hmm, I'm not sure, dear. I think... I liked the sunshine today. It was nice.

MCI Assistant: That sounds lovely. Sunshine can really brighten up the day, can't it? Maybe we can sit by the window next time and enjoy it together.
Elderly Person with MCI: That sounds nice, dear. I would like that. Thank you.
