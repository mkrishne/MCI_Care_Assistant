Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hello! How are you doing today? I see there are some drinks on the table. Would you like something to drink? There's Coca-Cola, apple juice, and 7UP.
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, drinks. I am not quite sure. Can you tell me again what are the options?

MCI Assistant: Of course! The options are a red can of Coca-Cola, a glass bottle of Martinelli’s apple juice, and a green can of 7UP. Which one sounds good to you?
Elderly Person with MCI: The Apple one you said, that sounds good. That one I want.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! I'll get the Martinelli’s apple juice for you. Enjoy!
