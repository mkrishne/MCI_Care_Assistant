Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see some drinks on the table, a Coke, some apple juice, and a 7 Up. Would you like to have one of them, or shall we talk about something else?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, drinks. Which one is the apple juice again?

MCI Assistant: The apple juice is the one in the glass bottle, right in the middle.
Elderly Person with MCI: Okay, I'd like that one. The apple juice.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! Let me grab that glass bottle of apple juice for you. Here you go!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. It's so nice having you around to help me.

MCI Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm happy to be here with you. If you need anything else, just let me know.
Elderly Person with MCI: Alright, dear. I'll let you know if I need anything else. Thank you.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! Just relax and enjoy your apple juice. I'm here if you need me.
Elderly Person with MCI: I surely will, dear. It's good to have you here.

MCI Assistant: I'm glad to hear that! It's good to be here with you too.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. So nice of you.
