Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see you've got some drinks on the table. Would you like me to get you any of them?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, yes. What were the options again? I can't seem to remember.

MCI Assistant: No problem! There's a red can of Coca-Cola, a glass bottle of Martinelli's apple juice, and a green can of 7UP. Which one would you like to have?
Elderly Person with MCI: Well, I think I'd like the red can. No, wait. Was that Coca-something?

MCI Assistant: Yes, the red can is Coca-Cola. Would you like to have that?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, the Coca-Cola. Could you please hand it to me?

MCI Assistant: Of course! Here you go, enjoy your Coca-Cola.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. I appreciate your help.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! If you need anything else, just let me know.
Elderly Person with MCI: Alright, thank you. I will.

MCI Assistant: Great! I'm here if you need anything.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. That's very kind of you.
