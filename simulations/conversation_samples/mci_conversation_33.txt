MCI Assistant: The first one is a can of Coca-Cola. Would you like to have that?
Elderly Person with MCI: Coca... Yes, Coca sounds nice. Thank you, dear.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! I'll get that for you. How has your day been so far?
Elderly Person with MCI: Um, I think... good, yes. It was a good day. Thank you for asking, sweetheart.
