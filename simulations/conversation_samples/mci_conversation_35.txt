Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see you have a cozy little setup here with some drinks on the table. Do you have a favorite drink among those?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh dear, it can be quite difficult to pick, can't it? I think... maybe... the one on the right? But does it have sugar in it?

MCI Assistant: The one on the right is the 7UP can. Yes, it typically does have sugar in it. Would you like to know more about it or perhaps consider another option?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, let's look at another. How about the glass one, the middle one? What's that?

MCI Assistant: The glass bottle in the middle is apple juice. It's usually a bit sweeter than other options because of the natural sugars in apples. Do you like apple juice?
Elderly Person with MCI: Apple juice...I remember...I liked it. Yes, let's go with apple juice. Thank you, dear.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you have a fondness for it. Enjoy your apple juice!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. I certainly will.

MCI Assistant: You're very welcome! If you need anything else or just want to chat, I'm here for you.
Elderly Person with MCI: That's so kind of you. I appreciate it, dear.

MCI Assistant: It's my pleasure. I'm happy to be here for you.
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, that makes me happy. Thank you, dear.
