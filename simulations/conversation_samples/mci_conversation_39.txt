Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see there are some drinks on the table. Would you like a Coca-Cola, apple juice, or maybe a 7-Up?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh dear, you know my memory isn't what it used to be. Is the Coca-Cola the fizzy one?

MCI Assistant: Yes, that's right. Coca-Cola is the fizzy one. Would you like to have some?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, then I think I would like the other one... the apple something...

MCI Assistant: Sure, that's the apple juice. It's not fizzy. I'll get that for you.
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh yes, thank you dear. That's nice.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! Just let me know if you need anything else.
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, I will. Thank you, dear.

MCI Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm here if you need anything.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. I appreciate your help.

MCI Assistant: You're always welcome. It's my pleasure to help!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. You're so kind.
