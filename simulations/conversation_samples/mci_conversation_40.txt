MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see you have some drinks on the table. Would you like to have something to drink or talk about your day?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, drinks? Yes, I'd like one please. Could you remind me what's on the table again?

MCI Assistant: Sure! Thereâ€™s a can of Coca-Cola, a bottle of Martinelli's apple juice, and a can of 7UP. Which one would you like?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh...umm, the Martin...Mart..?, the apple one, yes, I'd like that.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! I'll get the Martinelli's apple juice for you. Enjoy!
Elderly Person with MCI: Ah, thank you, dear. Apple juice always tastes good.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! Apple juice is a lovely choice. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?
