Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! Looks like you have some drinks on the table. Are you in the mood for a Coca-Cola, some apple juice, or perhaps a 7UP?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, apple juice... Do I like that one?

MCI Assistant: Yes, you do! Martinelli's apple juice is especially nice and refreshing. Would you like to try some?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, I guess I'll try that apple juice then.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! I'll get the apple juice for you. Let me know how you like it.
Elderly Person with MCI: Alright. Thank you, dear.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! Enjoy your apple juice. Let me know if you need anything else.
Elderly Person with MCI: Okay, dear. I will.

MCI Assistant: I'm here whenever you need me! Enjoy the rest of your evening.
Elderly Person with MCI: You too, dear. Thank you.

MCI Assistant: Thank you! Take care and have a peaceful night.
