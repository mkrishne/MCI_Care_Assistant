Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! It's a cozy little setup here. Would you like something to drink from the tableâ€”maybe a Coca-Cola, apple juice, or 7UP?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, I am not sure. What's that red one again?

MCI Assistant: The red one is a can of Coca-Cola. Would you like to try it?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh yes, Coca-Cola... I'd like that one, dear.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! Let me grab that for you. Here you go, enjoy your Coca-Cola!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. Very kind of you.
