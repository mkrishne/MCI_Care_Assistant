Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: I see you've got a few drinks here. Would you like one, or is there a favorite you like among them?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, there are drinks? Can I have the one with the orange label? It looks familiar.

MCI Assistant: Sure, the one with the orange label is the Martinelli's apple juice. I'll get it for you. Would you like a glass or just the bottle?
