Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see you're at the table with some drinks. Would you like to enjoy a nice can of Coca-Cola or perhaps some apple juice?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, drinks? Is there any... apple something?

MCI Assistant: Yes, there's a bottle of Martinelli's apple juice on the table. Would you like some?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, yes, yes. I think I remember that one. I'll have that.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! Martinelli's apple juice is very refreshing. I'll get that for you.
