Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hey there! How's everything going here in Room 202? Looks like you have some different drinks in front of you. Do you have a favorite among the Coca-Cola, Martinelli's apple juice, and 7 Up?
Elderly Person with MCI: Hmm, I like cola. But does that one have the bubbles? I kind of like the bubbles. But appleâ€¦ now, that sounds nice too. I'm just not sure.

MCI Assistant: Yes, Coca-Cola does have bubbles! It's fizzy and refreshing. Martinelli's apple juice is delicious as well, with a nice apple flavor. If you're in the mood for some bubbles, maybe give the cola a try! What do you think?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, the cola is bubbly, then? I think I'll try that one. Nothing like a nice fizzy drink, right?

MCI Assistant: Absolutely, a nice fizzy drink can be really refreshing! Enjoy your Coca-Cola. Let me know how you like it!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. I'm sure it will be lovely. You're always so helpful.

MCI Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your drink, and if you need anything else, just let me know!
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, yes. I'll enjoy this cola. You're a good one, you are. Thank you again.

MCI Assistant: Thank you for the kind words! I'm happy to be here for you. Enjoy your cola, and feel free to reach out if you need anything else!
Elderly Person with MCI: I will, dear. You're a great help. Thanks again.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad to help. Enjoy your evening!
Elderly Person with MCI: You too, dear.  Enjoy your evening as well.
