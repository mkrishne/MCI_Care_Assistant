Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! It's nice to be here with you. Are you interested in having something to drink? We've got a can with a red label, a clear glass bottle with a golden liquid, and a green can. Anything catching your eye?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, I'm not sure sweetheart. The clear glass bottle, maybe? Is that apple juice? I don't remember clearly.

MCI Assistant: No worries! The clear glass bottle with the golden liquid and yellow label might be apple juice. Would you like me to pour you some so you can try it?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, yes. That sounds good. Thank you, dear.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! Let me pour you some of that golden liquid from the clear bottle. I hope you enjoy it. If there's anything else you need, just let me know!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thanks, love. That's kind of you. I like this golden liquid. I think itâ€™s apple juice.

MCI Assistant: I'm glad you like it! Apple juice is always a nice choice. Would you like to sit and chat for a bit while you enjoy your drink?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh yes, that sounds nice. A little company would be lovely. Thank you.


MCI Assistant: Of course! I'm here with you. Let's enjoy a nice chat together. How has your day been so far?
Elderly Person with MCI: Well, it's been quite okay. I can't remember what I did today but it was a good day as far as I know. Thanks for asking, dear.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad to hear it was a good day. Sometimes, just feeling content is the best way to end the day. If you'd like, we can think of something nice to do tomorrow.
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, that sounds lovely! Yes, let's plan for tomorrow. But, remind me again, dear, what we're drinking? I seem to have forgotten already.
