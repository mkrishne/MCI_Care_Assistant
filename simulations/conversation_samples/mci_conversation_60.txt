Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see you have a few drink options on the table. Would you like a Coke, apple juice, or maybe a 7-Up to enjoy tonight?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, yes... I think the one in the middle, that apple something, right?

MCI Assistant: Yes, that's Martinelli's apple juice. Would you like me to get it for you?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, please. I think I like that one. Yes... apple juice.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! I'll get that apple juice for you right away. Enjoy!
