Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! It looks like you have a nice little setup on the table with some drinks. Do you feel like having a Coca-Cola, apple juice, or maybe a 7UP to refresh yourself?
Elderly Person with MCI: Hmm, I think, um, let's see. The... the apple thing... Is that what you said?

MCI Assistant: Yes, that's right! It's a bottle of Martinelli's apple juice. Would you like to have some?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, yes. I'd like that. Apple juice, yes. I like apple.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! Apple juice is delicious. Let me get that for you.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you... Uh, thank you dear. Appreciate it.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! I'm happy to help. Let me know if you need anything else.
