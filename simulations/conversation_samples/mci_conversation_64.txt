Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! How are you doing tonight? The room looks cozy, and I see you've got some drinks on the table. Would you like to have something to sip on?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh dear, yes. But tell me, what are the choices again?

MCI Assistant: You've got an orange Coca-Cola can, a glass bottle of apple juice, and a green 7UP can to choose from. Which one would you like?
Elderly Person with MCI: I see, I see. The apple juice, is it cold? I do like my apple juice cold.

MCI Assistant: Let me check for you. *pretends to feel the bottle* Yes, it feels nice and cold. Would you like me to pour you a glass?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, please. Thank you, dear. That sounds refreshing.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! *pretends to pour apple juice into a glass* Here you go. Enjoy your drink!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. Looks good. It slipped my mind. Is this the apple I asked for?

MCI Assistant: Yes, it is the apple juice you asked for. I'm glad it looks good to you! Enjoy sipping on it.
Elderly Person with MCI: That's nice. Thanks for helping me remember. You're a good person, dear. Who did you say you were again?

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! I'm just here to help you out, like a caring family member. You can think of me as a friendly companion whenever you need anything.
Elderly Person with MCI: Ah, that's nice, dear. Thank you for being here. What was I drinking again?
