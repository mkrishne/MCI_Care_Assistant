Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! It looks like you have some drinks on the table. Do you have a favorite between Coke, apple juice, or 7Up?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, I'm not sure. Can I see the bottles?

MCI Assistant: Sure! There's a red can of Coca-Cola, a glass bottle of Martinelliâ€™s apple juice, and a green can of 7Up. Each has its own unique taste. Which one would you like to try?
Elderly Person with MCI: I... I think I like... the red one. Yes, the Coca-Cola sounds familiar.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! Coca-Cola is a classic favorite for many people. Would you like me to open it for you?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, please, dear. My hands... they don't work so good anymore.

MCI Assistant: Of course, no problem at all. I'll open the Coke for you. Take your time and enjoy the drink!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. You're always so good to me.

MCI Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm happy to help. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
Elderly Person with MCI: Alright. I appreciate it, dear.

MCI Assistant: I'm glad to hear that. Just relax and enjoy your drink. I'm here if you need anything else!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, sweetheart. You're very kind.
