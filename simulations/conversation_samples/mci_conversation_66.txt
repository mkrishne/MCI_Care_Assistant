Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: It sounds like you're in a cozy meeting room. Would you like to talk about the drinks on the table, or maybe share how your day has been so far?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, drinks will do. It's hard to remember, what's this drink here?

MCI Assistant: Sure! From left to right on the table, there's a can of Coke, a glass bottle of Martinelli's apple juice, and a can of 7Up. Which one are you curious about?
Elderly Person with MCI: Hmmm, the one in the middle, apple juice was it?

MCI Assistant: Yes, that's right! The one in the middle is a glass bottle of Martinelli's apple juice. It's a delicious and refreshing choice. Would you like to try it?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, let's try that one. I remember liking apple juice.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! Let me help you with that. I hope it brings back some good memories. Enjoy!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you dear. I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

MCI Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. Let me know if you need anything else. Enjoy your apple juice!
Elderly Person with MCI: Sure, thank you. This apple juice is nice.

MCI Assistant: I'm so glad you like it! Martinelli's is known for its quality. Is there anything else you'd like to chat about or do?
Elderly Person with MCI: No, I'm good. Just enjoying this juice now. Thank you.
