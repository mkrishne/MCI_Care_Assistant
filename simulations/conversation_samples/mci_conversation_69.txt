Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see you've got some drinks on the table. Which one is your favorite among Coke, apple juice, and 7 Up?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh... um... I think I like the apple one... yes?

MCI Assistant: That's great! Martinelliâ€™s apple juice is quite refreshing. Do you often drink apple juice, or is it more of a special treat for you?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, I... I'm not sure, dear. I just know it's the one I like...sometimes.


MCI Assistant: That's perfectly fine! Enjoying it whenever you feel like it is what matters. Would you like to talk about anything else that's on your mind?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh... er... I saw a bird on the tree today. It was nice.

MCI Assistant: That sounds lovely! Birds can be so peaceful to watch. Do you often notice them around your place?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes, sometimes... I think so. They're all so pretty.

MCI Assistant: They really are. It's nice to take a moment to enjoy their beauty. Do you have a favorite kind of bird?
Elderly Person with MCI: I... um... I can't recall. But I like the one with the red belly.

MCI Assistant: That sounds like a robin! They have such a cheerful appearance with their red bellies. It's nice you got to see one today.
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, a robin... yes, that's the one. They're really nice to watch. Makes me happy.
