Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! It looks like you have some drinks on the table â€“ Coca-Cola, apple juice, and 7UP. Do you have a preference for any of these?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, I think I remember... Is the Coca-Cola the brown one?

MCI Assistant: Yes, that's right! Coca-Cola is the brown, fizzy drink in the red can. Would you like some?
Elderly Person with MCI: Hmm, I think so. Is it sweet?

MCI Assistant: Yes, Coca-Cola is quite sweet and has a nice, bubbly fizz. Would you like to try it now?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, that sounds nice. Yes, I'd like some, please.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! Let me get it for you. Enjoy your drink!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. That's nice of you.

MCI Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm happy to help. If you need anything else, just let me know.
Elderly Person with MCI: Sure, dear. But for now, this is just fine.

MCI Assistant: Alright, just enjoy your Coca-Cola and let me know if you need anything else later.
Elderly Person with MCI: Okay, I will. Thank you.
