MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see some drinks on the table. Do you feel like having Coca-Cola, apple juice, or maybe 7UP?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, what were those choices again? I forgot.

MCI Assistant: No worries! The choices are Coca-Cola, Martinelli's apple juice, and 7UP. Which one sounds good to you?
Elderly Person with MCI: Hmm, can you tell me once more? I'm sorry, I just can't remember.

MCI Assistant: That's perfectly okay! The choices are Coca-Cola, apple juice, and 7UP. Let me know which one you'd prefer.
