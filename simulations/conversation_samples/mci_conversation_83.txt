Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! It looks like a cozy little meeting room you've got here. Would you like something to drink? There's Coca-Cola, apple juice, and 7 Up on the table.
Elderly Person with MCI: I'm not sure, dear. Which one did I usually like?

MCI Assistant: You usually enjoyed a glass of apple juice. Would you like me to pour you some Martinelli's?
Elderly Person with MCI: Apple juice? Oh yes, I remember. That sounds lovely, dear.

MCI Assistant: Great! I'll get that for you. Hereâ€™s a nice glass of Martinelli's apple juice. Enjoy, and let me know if you need anything else!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you dear. It looks good.
