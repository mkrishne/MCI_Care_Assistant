Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! Looks like you have a Coca-Cola, some apple juice, and a 7UP on the table. Is there one you'd like to enjoy?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, um... I think... maybe the red one?

MCI Assistant: Great choice! The red one is the Coca-Cola. Would you like me to open it for you?
Elderly Person with MCI: Yes please, could you do that for me?

MCI Assistant: Of course! *Opens the Coca-Cola can for you* Here you go, enjoy your drink!
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, thank you dear. I appreciate it.

Elderly Person with MCI: Will do, thank you.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! I'm here if you need anything.
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear.

MCI Assistant: Anytime!
