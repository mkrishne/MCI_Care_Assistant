Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! I see you have some drinks on the table. Would you like to enjoy one together while we chat?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, yes dear. But, I'm not sure which one to have. Can you help me?

MCI Assistant: Of course! If you're in the mood for something sweet, the apple juice could be nice. If you prefer something fizzy, you might enjoy the Coca-Cola or the 7UP. Which one sounds good to you?
Elderly Person with MCI: Apple juice? That could be nice. Do we have that one?

MCI Assistant: Yes, we do! There's a bottle of Martinelli's apple juice on the table. Would you like me to get it for you?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, yes please. That sounds good. Thank you, dear.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! Let me grab that for you. Here you go, enjoy your apple juice!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you so much, dear! It looks really good.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! I'm glad you like it. Do you want to talk about anything while you sip your juice?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, nothing special, dear. Just enjoying my juice and spending time with you.

MCI Assistant: That sounds perfect. I'm happy to be here with you. Let me know if you need anything else!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. I think this juice is all I need for now.
