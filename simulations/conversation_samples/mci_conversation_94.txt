Conversation between MCI Assistant and Elderly Person with MCI:

MCI Assistant: Hi there! It looks like someone set up some drinks on the table. Do you feel like having a Coca-Cola, some apple juice, or maybe a 7UP?
Elderly Person with MCI: Oh, umm... what were the choices again, dear?

MCI Assistant: Sure! There's a red can of Coca-Cola, a glass bottle of Martinelli's Apple Juice, and a green can of 7UP. Which one would you like?
Elderly Person with MCI: Ah, um, let's go with the...uh... red one, please.

MCI Assistant: Great choice! I'll get the Coca-Cola for you. Enjoy!
Elderly Person with MCI: Thank you, dear. Very kind of you.

MCI Assistant: You're welcome! If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
