Result 18:
You are looking at a round wooden table in a meeting room with three chairs. On the table, there are three drinks arranged in a line. From left to right, there is a red can of Coca-Cola, a glass bottle of Martinelli’s apple juice, and a green can of 7UP. The room appears to have a neutral, plain wall in the background.
