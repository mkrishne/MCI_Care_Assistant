Result 60:
You are looking at a round wooden table with three beverages placed on it. From left to right, there is a can of Coca-Cola, a bottle of Martinelli's apple juice, and a can of 7-Up. In the background, there are three black office chairs around the table, set in a simple, well-lit room with white walls and a carpeted floor.
