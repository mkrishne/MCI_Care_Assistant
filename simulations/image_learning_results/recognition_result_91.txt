Result 91:
You are looking at a round wooden conference table with three beverages on it. From left to right, there is a can of Coca-Cola, a bottle of Martinelli's apple juice, and a can of 7UP. Behind the table, there are three office-style chairs, and the room appears to be a meeting space with a neutral color scheme.
